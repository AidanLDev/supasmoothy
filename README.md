This is a little project I set-up to learn the basics of Supabase
The reason for an app like this is that it has all the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
I figured if I could do those things with a Supabase database I can do 90% of the things I'd need to use the database for

So come on, make, edit and delete some smoothies!

The course is well paced and clear, big shout out to Shaun aka the Net Ninja
